griz.sh is my site. I run it on a multinode bare metal kubernetes cluster. If it seems slow, it's because we are on point to point protocol for internet. At the time of making this about page I have 3 seperate apps running. 2 are made with hugo and deployed with nginx deployments, and content is filled by rsyncing to the pvc. The 3rd is a multiapp django application. I deploy static content with white noise and use gunicorn for the webserver. Instead of using nginx to route traffic I route with istio. 

- griz.sh/griz is where I render my database for my dog training
- griz.sh/tech is where I render my database for tech videos
- tech.griz.sh is where I have my tech journal. This is just random notes and thoughts. It's been helpful in the past when recreating stuff.
- docs.griz.sh this is this site. I'll make documentatino here for myself and others.
