# Hugo Themes
## [Official Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
You can probably find unofficial themes with a google search, but this is good enough for me. For this site I clicked the tag docs on the side, and looked through a few. I chose this one because it's simple, has no npm packages, and has an example site that's ready for use. 


If you want something fancier, you pick a theme and look through the setup instructions. Many fancy themes rely on sass or npm, use your package manager to install what is missing. Come to me if you have trouble, and I can walk you through a specific setup.
